# Verena Docker Images

We have some large data objects. To keep them up and running properly, we can use Docker. Note that we aim to build our Docker images ourselves to be maximually useful to us and with our data. However, much of our image architecture is based off of the excellent images from the [Rocker Organization](https://rocker-project.org/). 

## Virion 

Right now the only data product running on a `viralemergence` curated image is Virion. This is still in dev.
